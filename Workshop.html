                            This is Serenity Renewal for Families’ Anchor Workshop: all family members are encouraged to attend this workshop, either together or on your own!
                           At Serenity Renewal for Families, we believe that addictions and recovery are a family affair. Whether you are personally struggling with addiction, are in the early stages of recovery, have been in recovery for a while or if you are a family member affected by a family member’s addiction, our one-day workshop is designed for you. During the workshop, all participants will explore various recovery pathways and receive valuable information to help guide their next steps on the journey toward healing and recovery.

                            Codependent behaviour is a learned coping style that includes hyper focusing on others while being unable to express one’s own needs. Learn to reclaim your identity and create authentic relationships.

                            In active addictions, in recovery, or as a family member, resentment is known as the number one offender because we find that we are unable to cope with the painful feelings and turn to escapism and numbing behaviours which fuel the cycle of anger, resentment, relapse and addictions. In our journey of healing and recovery, we must find a way to deal with this cycle in a different way. This workshop brings awareness to the cycle of anger and provides helpful coping strategies. This workshop provides the opportunity to explore the roots of our resentments so we can open ourselves up to a path of healing and letting go.

                            Shame is grounded in an overwhelming feeling of brokenness. We believe ourselves to be defective or unworthy. Guilt is different. It is the feeling that comes when we are aware of having made a mistake or having done something wrong or improper. Feelings of shame and guilt may cause us to believe ourselves unworthy of the serenity that would come from following a journey of recovery and healing. Facing shame and guilt is important for those of us wanting to accept a spiritual path of trust, humility, tolerance, and gratitude.

                            In active addictions, in recovery, or as a family member, resentment is known as the number one offender because we find that we are unable to cope with the painful feelings and turn to escapism and numbing behaviours which fuel the cycle of anger, resentment, relapse and addictions. In our journey of healing and recovery, we must find a way to deal with this cycle in a different way. This workshop brings awareness to the cycle of anger and provides helpful coping strategies. This workshop provides the opportunity to explore the roots of our resentments so we can open ourselves up to a path of healing and letting go. (In-Person)

                            Living with or losing a loved one to addictions will often make our grief more complicated. Last year alone, Canada reported 67,000 substance use-related deaths. Even if our loved ones are still alive, the grief of losing them to their addiction is complex. Societal stigma often prevents us from sharing our grief with others, especially when we may be met with judgement and misunderstanding. Can we do anything about the inner voices of self-judgement and criticism? Join this workshop to share your grief journey in a safe and compassionate space. (Virtual)

                            Shame is grounded in an overwhelming feeling of brokenness. We believe ourselves to be defective or unworthy. Guilt is different. It is the feeling that comes when we are aware of having made a mistake or having done something wrong or improper. Feelings of shame and guilt may cause us to believe ourselves unworthy of the serenity that would come from following a journey of recovery and healing. Facing shame and guilt is important for those of us wanting to accept a spiritual path of trust, humility, tolerance, and gratitude. (In-Person)

                            In active addictions, in recovery, or as a family member, resentment is known as the number one offender because we find that we are unable to cope with the painful feelings and turn to escapism and numbing behaviors which fuel the cycle of anger, resentment, relapse and addictions. In our journey of healing and recovery, we must find a way to deal with this cycle differently. This workshop brings awareness to the cycle of anger and provides helpful coping strategies. This workshop provides the opportunity to explore the roots of our resentments so we can open ourselves up to a path of healing and letting go. (In-Person Only)

                            Shame is grounded in an overwhelming feeling of brokenness. We believe ourselves to be defective or unworthy. Guilt is different. It is the feeling that comes when we are aware of having made a mistake or having done something wrong or improper. Feelings of shame and guilt may cause us to believe ourselves unworthy of the serenity that would come from following a journey of recovery and healing. Facing shame and guilt is important for those of us wanting to accept a spiritual path of trust, humility, tolerance, and gratitude. (Hybrid: In-person or Virtual)

                            Anger and Resentment are simply defined as “bitter indignation at having been treated unfairly”. Our addiction and codependency literature identifies resentment as the single most dangerous character defect in our journey of healing and recovery. This workshop will provide the opportunity to explore the roots of our resentments, how they get triggered in everyday life and how we are able to let go of the old wounds at the root of our suffering.

                            There are never simple answers for our individual experiences of grief, loss and sorrow. Addictive and codependent behaviours in ourselves and in our loved ones will often make our grief more complicated and harder to understand. What do we mean when we talk about a healing journey for our sorrow? Is there a way to distinguish between grief, sorrow, and depression? What are the symptoms of grief? Can I do anything about the inner voices of self-judgment and criticism? Why is it comforting to share with others who have experienced similar grief and loss? (Virtual only)
